POC for FB Collector App
---
The goal of this app is to be embedded in a Facebook Page Tab so that when rendered, it prompts
the user to provide access to their facebook details. This app should then write those details, 
including facebook user id, email address and name to a Data Extension in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
